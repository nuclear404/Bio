# 🐍 Learning Python – One Line at a Time  

Hi, I'm Konstantinos. I'm figuring out Python, breaking things, fixing them (sometimes), and slowly making sense of it all.  

## ⚡ What I'm Doing  
- Writing code that *mostly* works  
- Googling errors like a pro  
- Avoiding tutorials that promise to make me an "expert in 24 hours"  
- Building stuff just to see if I can  

## 💭 No Big Promises  
Not here to impress—just here to learn.  
If you're also figuring things out, feel free to check out my repos.

## 💭 Why "nuclear404"?  
In a world full of distractions and noise, my goal is to go **nuclear**—focused and relentless—on what truly matters: learning and growth.
Along the way, I'll hit plenty of **"404" errors**, but every failure is just fuel for better outcomes.
